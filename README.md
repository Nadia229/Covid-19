#An Application of Deep Learning of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Detection using Chest X-ray Images


#The Datasets
The database folder contains all the feature for the project. Download database folder for the codes to run properly.
•	Here have two folder covid and non_covid which used for training and testing purpose.


#The Codes
[classifiers]()
•	"covid-19 CNN.ipynb" contains the entire code for feature selection and classifying the sequential cnn model.
•	" covid-19 ANN.ipynb " contains the entire code for feature selection and classifying the sequential ann model.
•	"final_auto_encoding.ipynb " contains the code for better performance.
•	"encoding_model_with_sequential_mode_covid.ipynb " contains the entire code where taking the model after encoding and then merge it with a sequential multi-layer cnn model.


[Performance Metrics]() 
The classifiers were evaluated using this metrics:
•	Accuracy
•	Sensitivity or Recall
•	Specificity
•	Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC)
•	F1_score
•	Area under the curve (AUC)
•	Receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
